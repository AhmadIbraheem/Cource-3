				First things first
				I'mma say all the words inside my head
				I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh
				The way that things have been, oh ooh

				Second things second
				Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
				I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh</p>

				<h2>Frank senatra-sway</h2>
				<p>When marimba rhythms start to play
				Dance with me, make me sway
				Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
				Hold me close, sway me more
				Like a flower bending in the breeze
				Bend with me, sway with ease
				When we dance you have a way with me
				Stay with me, sway with me
				Other dancers may be on the floor
				Dear, but my eyes will see only you
				Only you have the magic technique
				When we sway I go weak

				<h2>Maroon 5-memories</h2>
				<p>Here's to the ones that we got
				Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
				'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
				Of everything we've been through
				Toast to the ones here today
				Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
				'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
				And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
